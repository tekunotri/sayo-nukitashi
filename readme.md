# sayo-nukitashi

originally i wanted to edit Sayo to look like the version soapymeister used in [some frag vids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqfDzzBsviY) until i decided this was *slightly* more fun (also because i was bored and this has been on my mind for a little bit)

edits are mostly minimal, not a lot in the gameplay side, some work put into the loadout/etc screens

note: menu sounds dont work on pure 2 servers, so to avoid earrape please delete the sound/ui folder
